Q1: What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A1: True and False, using capitol T and F, with the rest of the word in lowercase.

Q2: What are the three Boolean operators?
A2: and, or and not

Q3: Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean vaules for the
    operator and what they evaluate to).
A3: True and True is True
    True and False is False
    False and True is False
    False and False is False
    True or True is True
    True or False is True
    False or True is True
    False or False is is False
    not True is False
    not False is True

Q4: What do the following expressions evaluate to?

    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
    not (5 > 4)
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
    not (( 5 > 4 ) or (3 == 5))
    (True and True) and (True == True)
    (Not False) or (not True)

A4: False
    False
    True
    False
    False
    True

Q5: What are the six comparison operators?
A5: ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.

Q6: What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
A6: == is the equal to operator that compares two calues and evaluates to a Boolean, while = is the assignment operator
    that stores a value in a variable.

Q7: Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
A7: A condition is an expression used in a flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean value.

Q8: Identify the three blocks in this code:

    spam = 0
    if spam == 10:
        print('eggs")
        if spam > 5:
            print('bacon')
        else:
            print('ham')
        print('spam')
    print('spam')

A8: The three blocks are everything inside the if statement and the lines print('bacon') and print ('ham')

Q9: Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greeting! if anything else is stored in spam.
A9: The code:

    while True:
    print('Type the number 1 or 2.')
    spam = input()
    if spam == '1':
        print('Hello')
    elif spam == '2':
        print('Howdy')
    else:
        print('Greetings!')

Q10: What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
A10: Press CTRL-C to stop a program stuck in an infinite loop.

Q11: What is the difference between break and continue?
A11: The break statement will move the execution outside and just after a loop. The continue statement will move the execution to the start
     of the loop.

Q12: What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
A12: They all do the same thing. The range(10) call ranges from 0 up to (but not including ) 10, range(0, 10) explicity tells the loop to start at 0
     , and range(0, 10, 1) tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration.

Q13: Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1
     to 10 using a while loop.
A13: The code:

     for i in range(1, 11):
     print(i)

     i = 1
     while i < 11:
         print(i)
         i = i + 1

Q14: If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
A14: This function can be called with spam.bacon()
